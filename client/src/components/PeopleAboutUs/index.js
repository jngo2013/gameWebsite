              The local rules lawyer, co-op advocate, and camera coordinator, I am constantly looking to optimize in both games and recording content. When a specific issue comes up, I'm either asking about it, or...using it to my advantage.

              <p>
                I love the board game world! There is something wonderful about sitting around a table with people and a game in front of us that brings closer connections with one other. An extra bonus is when there are drinking rules (alcoholic beverages and non-alcoholic beverages). My strategy when playing a strategic game (whether it is co-op or not) is to be in my own world and analyze other player's moves. I'll be that "quiet player" that does their own thing and everyone forgets about and ends up winning the game. It works like a charm (most of the time).

                I spend most of my time behind the scene for Drunk on Games as a video editor providing great content for the viewers. So if you see me in a video, comment on that video a cherry blossom flower "ðŸŒ¸" emoji!
